Introduction
Handwritten image classification is a common task in computer vision and is often used as a benchmark for testing new deep learning models. This project uses a Convolutional Neural Network (CNN) to classify images of handwritten digits/letters from a popular dataset.

Dataset
The dataset used in this project is the MNIST dataset for digit classification or the EMNIST dataset for extended character classification. The MNIST dataset contains 60,000 training images and 10,000 testing images of handwritten digits (0-9). Each image is grayscale and has a size of 28x28 pixels.

Alternatively, if you are using a custom dataset, please ensure the images are preprocessed to the appropriate format.

Dependencies
To run this project, you'll need the following dependencies:

Python 3.8+
  TensorFlow 2.x
  Keras
  NumPy
  Pandas
  Matplotlib
  Jupyter Notebook

Model Architecture
The model is built using a Convolutional Neural Network (CNN), which is well-suited for image classification tasks. The architecture consists of the following layers:

  Input Layer: Takes in the 28x28 pixel images.
  Convolutional Layers: Extracts features from the images.
  Pooling Layers: Reduces the dimensionality of the feature maps.
  Fully Connected Layers: Classifies the images based on the extracted features.
  Output Layer: Produces the probability distribution over the classes.

Training
The model is trained using the training dataset. The training process involves:

Data Augmentation: To improve the model's robustness, data augmentation techniques such as rotation, zoom, and shift are applied.
Loss Function: Categorical Crossentropy is used as the loss function since this is a multi-class classification problem.
Optimizer: The Adam optimizer is used to minimize the loss function.
Metrics: Accuracy is used as the primary metric for evaluation during training.
